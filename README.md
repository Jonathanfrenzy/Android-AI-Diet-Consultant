## Feedback and Contribution
I made Every effort was made to complete and build all the features described but the work is still in development.
In alot of cases some scenarios might have been hardcoded into the code
Several efforts have still to be placed to make the chatbot features effective
i am open to contributions to increase the efficency of the application
feel free to submit an issue
